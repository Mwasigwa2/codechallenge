The challenge required me to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript by completing a set of coding tasks divided
into three questions.

The challenge was mainly based on JavaScript, so I used the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- Replit (to run my tests using node.js)

## How To Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command

   git clone git@github.com:Mwasigwa2/codechallenge.git 
   
   (which is accessed by clicking the code button and copying the SSH)

2. Navigate to the project using the command cd  (ie cd codechallenge)

3. Install necessary dependencies using the command npm install

4. Run the code by inputing the command code . on your terminal

## Project Setup

The project contains the following files:
